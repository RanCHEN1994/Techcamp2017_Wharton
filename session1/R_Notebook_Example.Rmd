## R Markdown

\[ e = mc^2 \]

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(mtcars)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Beautiful Tables

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=T}
model1 = lm(mpg ~cyl + disp + hp + wt, data=mtcars)
model2 = lm(mpg ~., data=mtcars)
summary(model1)
```


\newpage

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
require(texreg)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
texreg(list(model1, model2))
```

For help, see `texreg`.
