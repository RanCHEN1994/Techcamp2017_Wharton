Take the list of Canadian PGA winners at the Wiki link below and turn it into a list of tuples with the year, first name, and last name as entries in each tuple.

- Example list of tuples:[(2014, “Alex”, “Miller”), (2013, “Bob”, “Ross”), … ]

I encourage you to do it in 100% Python for practice (but also try out the Google Sheets method).
